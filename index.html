                The trill of the blue jay can melt anyone's heart. I have watched these special birds
                since I was a little kid. They have such intelligence and complex social systems
                with tight family bonds.
            <p>
                The blue jay has a white feathered face with a blue crest, back, wings, and tail.
                It is also marked with black feathers. It is about 30 cm in length from the tip of
                its bill to the tip of its tail. They have a crest on their heads which is like a
                crown of feathers. When excited or frightened, their crest bristles outwards. Blue
                jays are native to eastern North America. They can be found in the eastern and
                central United States and across southern Canada.

                From 1966 to 2015, the Blue Jay population decreased along the Atlantic coast, but
                it still increased more than 15% throughout Labrador, Nova Scotia, Quebec, and Manitoba.
                It migrates in flocks along the Great Lakes and Atlantic coasts. Most Jays migrate south
                one year, stay north the next winter, and then migrate south again the next year.

                The Blue Jay may be noisy sometimes, but they are also quite bold. It flies with slow
                wing beats, making it easy prey for hawks and owls. Other predators like cats, crows,
                and raccoons may hunt for jay eggs. However, the Blue Jay has been known to sound an
                alarm call when hawks or other dangers are near. Young Blue Jays are well-known for
                being curious about brightly coloured or reflective objects, such as jewelry and coins.
                They will carry them around until they lose interest.

                I've always enjoyed feeding peanuts and almonds to Blue Jays. They are omnivorous birds
                with 75% of their diet being vegetables. Their fondness for acorns is credited with helping
                spread oak trees around the environment. It's food sources also include weed seeds, grain,
                peanuts, bread, meat, fruits and other berries.

                I've always wondered if the Blue jays around our house hide a nest nearby. It would be
                awesome to watch them hatch. Their mating season begins in mid-March and extends to July.
                They prefer evergreen trees for nesting. The nest is cup-shaped and made from twigs, small
                roots, bark, plants, and mud. Sometimes Blue jays may also build their nests in mailboxes
                or use nests built by other birds like robins. Blue jays mate for life and both parents build
                the nest. The male feeds the female while she is brooding the eggs. About 21 days after they
                hatch, the family travels together until early fall. They reach adulthood after one year of age.

                The sound of the blue jays singing outside is quite heartwarming. Their most common sound is
                their alarm call which sounds similar to a gull-scream. There is also a high-pitched screech
                sound at high speed when the bird becomes agitated. Blue jays will use these calls to help
                each other and drive away predators.

                In conclusion, I've always been very fond of the Blue jays. In my backyard, I watch them
                swoop down and land on my deck multiple times a day to retrieve the peanuts we put out for
                them. They remember how we feed them and come back every year. It's always an exciting day
                when they return to our house.
